====

Shogunate Map alteration sub MOD alpha version Version 0.2.9 'Aonae' is a submod of the Shogunate mod. It replaces map with a high-resolution one and increases the Provence-Baron territory.

[h2]CAUTION[/h2]
This mod is an alpha version.
There are known problems and unimplemented features.
Probably when this mod is upgraded, the saved data will no longer be available.
Please refrain from playing games with the goal of long-term continuation.
It is not compatible with the main mod, Shogunate save data.
Since map size is larger than the CK3 vanilla and main mod, a more powerful hardware configuration will be required.

[h2]Description[/h2]
[h3]Topography[/h3]
It is based on a newly generated height map from a real DEM (Digital Elevation Model), and currently uses the orthographic projection method centered on Tokyo (this may change in the future).
Map textures are drawn using elevation and actual land cover information.

[h3]Province[/h3]
The number of provinces in a county (equivalent to a county in the game) was determined based on the standard of one provincia for every 10,000 KOKU[GOKU]（石） of rice produced in a county (equivalent to a county in the game) at the end of the 15th century, with some exceptions. The number of Provinces in a Count's Domain is subject to change.
This is the shape of Province, created by combining the administrative divisions of Japan as of 1920.
The basic data for the map, heightmap.png and provinces.png, are newly created at 16,384 x 4,096 pixels, twice the size of the main mod. The number of provinces is 3140 about four times the number of the main mod (including sea areas, etc.).
The increased number of Provinces will give you more strategic and tactical options and bring you a new gameplay experience!

[h3]County[/h3]
Counties that existed in the 15th century have been reorganized to appear in the game, and the number of {z} county territories has been increased compared to the main mod.
Some counties were divided like counties that existed in modern times because they had a large number of Provinces or a large area.
Towns such as "Kyoto", "Osaka", "Nara", and "Sakai" were set up as independent county territories.
